test project based on clean architecture

its based on uncle bobs' clean architecture style. 

see : https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

api is pretty simple it accepts list of transactions , max block size and default block fee and it calculates max transaction fee.

it uses 0-1 knapsack algorithm .

see pseudo code for the dynamic program here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem.
